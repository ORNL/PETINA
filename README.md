**PETINA** is a general-purpose Python library for Differential Privacy (DP), designed for flexibility, modularity, and extensibility across a wide range of ML and data processing pipelines. It supports both numerical and categorical data, with tools for supervised and unsupervised tasks.
## TODO:
- [ ] Add 3 MA from Opals
- [ ] Noise multiplier will need to get the epsilon value Opacus
##  Features

PETINA includes state-of-the-art tools for:

###  Differential Privacy (DP) Mechanisms
- Laplace Mechanism
- Gaussian Mechanism
- Renyi-Gaussian Mechanism
- Exponential Mechanism
- Flip Coin Mechanism
- Pruning
- Pruning Adaptive
- Pruning DP
- Count Sketch

###  Clipping
- Adaptive Clipping
- Clipping
- Clipping DP

### Encoding and Pertubation
- Pertubation
- Aggregation & Estimation
- Parameter Utilities
- Encoding

### Data Conversion Helper
- Flatten NumPy array to list and get shape
- Reshape list to NumPy array with shape
- Flatten PyTorch tensor to list and get shape
- Reshape list to PyTorch tensor with shape
- Detect input type and flatten to list with shape
- Convert list back to original data type and shape

## Quick Start

Below is a real world example when adding noise to age of various person
```python
from PETINA import DP_Mechanisms, Encoding_Pertubation, Clipping, Pruning
import numpy as np
import random

# --- Real-world data: Users' ages from a survey ---
user_ages = [23, 35, 45, 27, 31, 50, 29, 42, 38, 33]
print("Original ages:", user_ages)

# --- DP parameters ---
sensitivity = 1  # Age changes by 1 at most for neighboring datasets
epsilon = 0.5    # Moderate privacy budget
delta = 1e-5
gamma = 0.001

# --- Add Laplace noise to ages ---
noisy_ages = DP_Mechanisms.applyDPLaplace(user_ages, sensitivity, epsilon)
print("\nNoisy ages with Laplace Mechanism:")
print(noisy_ages)

# --- Encode noisy ages using Unary Encoding ---
p = Encoding_Pertubation.get_p(epsilon)
q = Encoding_Pertubation.get_q(p, epsilon)
encoded_ages = Encoding_Pertubation.unaryEncoding(noisy_ages, p=p, q=q)
print("\nUnary encoded noisy ages:")
print(encoded_ages)

# --- Summary ---
print("\nSummary:")
print(f"Original ages: {user_ages}")
print(f"Noisy ages: {np.round(noisy_ages, 2)}")
#------OUTPUT------
# Original ages: [23, 35, 45, 27, 31, 50, 29, 42, 38, 33]

# Noisy ages with Laplace Mechanism:
# [21.46703958 34.93585449 47.36478841 25.68077936 30.11460444 49.3448666
#  28.8128474  36.54981691 37.6103979  33.32033856]

# Unary encoded noisy ages:
# [(33.320338556461415, np.float64(14.023220368761203)), (34.935854491045006, np.float64(5.97677963123879)), (36.54981690878978, np.float64(22.06966110628362)), (37.61039790139999, np.float64(-10.116101843806039)), (47.36478841495265, np.float64(-18.162542581328452)), (49.34486659855414, np.float64(14.023220368761203)), (21.467039579955127, np.float64(-18.162542581328452)), (25.6807793619914, np.float64(-2.069661106283625)), (28.812847396103876, np.float64(5.97677963123879)), (30.114604444236978, np.float64(-10.116101843806039))]

# Summary:
# Original ages: [23, 35, 45, 27, 31, 50, 29, 42, 38, 33]
# Noisy ages: [21.47 34.94 47.36 25.68 30.11 49.34 28.81 36.55 37.61 33.32]

We also provide hands-on [examples](./PETINA/examples/) in the examples folder.

- [Example 1](./PETINA/examples/tutorial1_basic.py): Basic PETINA Usage.
- [Example 2](./PETINA/examples/tutorial2_CountSketch_PureLDP.py): This example demonstrates how to perform frequency estimation on synthetic categorical data using various pure Local Differential Privacy (LDP) algorithms. It also compares PETINA's Count Mean Sketch (CMS) and CSVec-based sketching with baseline LDP methods and a centralized CMS variant.
- [Example 3](./PETINA/examples/tutorial3_Moment_Accounting.py): This script demonstrates differentially private training in PyTorch using PETINA with budget tracking, clipping, and noise injection.
- [Example 4](./PETINA/examples/tutorial4_csVec_implementation_PETINA.py): This script demonstrates how to apply PETINA's Count Sketch mechanism to lists, NumPy arrays, and PyTorch tensors for efficient data approximation.
- [Example 5](./PETINA/examples/tutorial5_PETINA_MA_Implement.py): This script runs a federated learning simulation with optional Laplace, Gaussian, or Count Sketch-based privacy mechanisms, integrated with PETINA's budget accountant to track and gracefully handle differential privacy budget consumption.
